# xemantic-openrndr-template

It's like [openrndr-template](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-template)
project but this time it contains also
[xemantic-openrndr](https://github.com/xemantic/xemantic-openrndr)
libraries and conventions for copying GLSL and media files
into the jar. There is also a `seed.sh` tool for bootstrapping
any project out of this one, with custom name.

## updates

Note: the `build.gradle.kts` should be synchronized every time
the same file in `openrndr-template` is updated.
